# üå± Becoming: A Self-Coaching Companion That Tells Your Story

**Becoming** is a progressive web app (PWA) for people who feel stuck, disconnected, or unsure what they want‚Äîbut know deep down something needs to change. It helps you reflect, reconnect with the forgotten parts of yourself, and move forward through story, not statistics.

> üß† This app uses your **own OpenAI API key**, stored locally and securely.
> üé§ It also lets you **speak your entries aloud**, using OpenAI Whisper for best-in-class transcription.
> üß™ Includes a "**Developer Mode**" for full prompt transparency, so users can see exactly how the AI is generating content.

## üß≠ What It *Really* Is

Becoming isn‚Äôt a habit tracker. It‚Äôs not a goal-setting app. It‚Äôs a **conversation**‚Äîbetween you and an intelligent mirror that learns who you are, bit by bit, and helps you become more of that person. It guides you **gently**, in real time, with questions that open doors.

> You don‚Äôt need to know what you want. You just need to be willing to show up and speak.

The app responds like a compassionate coach, letting you know why it asked a question, what it's doing with what you said, and where it‚Äôs going with you. It‚Äôs training, but not all at once‚Äîjust enough, just when you need it.

Becoming isn‚Äôt pushy. You‚Äôll never get a buzzy notification demanding your attention. But like a thoughtful friend, it may reach out with something meaningful:

* ‚ÄúHey, yesterday you said you were going on a walk this morning. Want to talk about how that went?‚Äù
* ‚ÄúYou mentioned being drawn to water‚Äîcheck out this video I found on fountains in desert landscapes.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúJust wondering how you're feeling. Want to talk?‚Äù

These nudges aren't reminders‚Äîthey‚Äôre **invitations to re-enter the conversation**. And they are always infused with knowledge of your personal context, such as:

* Special dates (sobriety milestones, birthdays, anniversaries)
* Recent reflections and patterns
* Weather, time of day, or opportunities based on your interests ("Perfect disc golf weather today in Georgetown‚Äîwanna get out there?")

---

## üß† How The AI Is Prompted

All nudges, reflections, and storytelling come from a large language model (LLM) like GPT-4o. The app builds smart prompts by including:

* A current snapshot of your **identity summary**, updated after each session
* Key **emotional themes** and symbolic language from your recent entries
* Past dates of importance and any events that are timely
* Any **recent user intentions** ("I want to try hiking," "I'm curious about building something with my hands")

The LLM is then asked to:

1. **Propose a gentle, context-aware nudge** that sounds like it‚Äôs from a caring friend
2. **Generate questions** that meet therapeutic standards and feel safe, open, and resonant
3. **Compose a narrative** (if requested) that integrates prior reflections into a creative myth or metaphor the user can relate to

The system prompts the AI with:

* Personality traits and tone of the user, learned over time
* Recent conversational entries (transcribed or typed)
* The symbolic/ritual themes emerging from their journey
* Specific occasion-based triggers (e.g., anniversaries, weather, follow-ups to past plans)

> **Developer Mode**: When enabled, users can view the raw AI prompt sent before each generation. This helps build trust, invites feedback, and demystifies the interaction.

Every time a prompt is sent, the app constructs it dynamically based on the stored summary, last few interactions, and system memory‚Äîall done **on-device**, with nothing sent to a server.

This ensures:

* The AI always ‚Äúremembers‚Äù who it‚Äôs talking to
* Nudges feel human and well-timed
* The tone stays aligned with the user‚Äôs story and personality

## üß† How It Remembers You

LLMs are stateless‚Äîthey don‚Äôt remember prior interactions unless the data is provided again. Becoming solves this through:

* **Ongoing Context Summaries**: After every entry, the AI updates a summary of who you are becoming‚Äîyour emotional landscape, key themes, and desires
* **Selective Recall**: When you speak again, the app includes this profile along with a few recent entries to maintain deep, personalized context
* **Symbolic Identity Mapping**: The app gradually builds a model of your archetypes, metaphors, tone, and emotional arcs‚Äîlike a coach who knows your soul
* **Context-Aware Nudges**: The app monitors for meaningful life dates and real-world conditions (weather, time of day, etc.) to deliver truly human-feeling check-ins

> This means: yes, when you come back tomorrow, the app *will* sound like it remembers who you are.
